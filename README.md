## API Description

<p>Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and applications.</p> <p>CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.</p> <p>In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.</p>

### <p>You can use the <code>GetMetricData</code> API to retrieve as many as 100 different metrics in a single request, with a total of as many as 100,800 datapoints. You can also optionally perform math expressions on the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new insights into your data. For example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For more information about metric math expressions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax">Metric Math Syntax and Functions</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Calls to the <code>GetMetricData</code> API have a different pricing structure than calls to <code>GetMetricStatistics</code>. For more information about pricing, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">Amazon CloudWatch Pricing</a>.</p> <p>Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.</p>

#### Input Parameters
* `MaxDatapoints` - _optional_ - Pagination limit
* `NextToken` - _optional_ - Pagination token
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Credential` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Security-Token` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>Gets statistics for the specified metric.</p> <p>The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order.</p> <p>CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.</p> <p>CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.</p> <p>Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.</p> <p>CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.</p> <p>For information about metrics and dimensions supported by AWS services, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html">Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Dimensions Reference</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p>

### <p>You can use the <code>GetMetricWidgetImage</code> API to retrieve a snapshot graph of one or more Amazon CloudWatch metrics as a bitmap image. You can then embed this image into your services and products, such as wiki pages, reports, and documents. You could also retrieve images regularly, such as every minute, and create your own custom live dashboard.</p> <p>The graph you retrieve can include all CloudWatch metric graph features, including metric math and horizontal and vertical annotations.</p> <p>There is a limit of 20 transactions per second for this API. Each <code>GetMetricWidgetImage</code> action has the following limits:</p> <ul> <li> <p>As many as 100 metrics in the graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Up to 100 KB uncompressed payload.</p> </li> </ul>

#### Input Parameters
* `Action` - _required_
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_

* `X-Amz-Security-Token` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>Returns a list of the dashboards for your account. If you include <code>DashboardNamePrefix</code>, only those dashboards with names starting with the prefix are listed. Otherwise, all dashboards in your account are listed. </p> <p> <code>ListDashboards</code> returns up to 1000 results on one page. If there are more than 1000 dashboards, you can call <code>ListDashboards</code> again and include the value you received for <code>NextToken</code> in the first call, to receive the next 1000 results.</p>

#### Input Parameters
* `NextToken` - _optional_ - Pagination token
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Credential` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Security-Token` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>List the specified metrics. You can use the returned metrics with <a>GetMetricData</a> or <a>GetMetricStatistics</a> to obtain statistical data.</p> <p>Up to 500 results are returned for any one call. To retrieve additional results, use the returned token with subsequent calls.</p> <p>After you create a metric, allow up to fifteen minutes before the metric appears. Statistics about the metric, however, are available sooner using <a>GetMetricData</a> or <a>GetMetricStatistics</a>.</p>

#### Input Parameters
* `NextToken` - _optional_ - Pagination token
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Credential` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Security-Token` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing dashboard. If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced with what you specify here.</p> <p>There is no limit to the number of dashboards in your account. All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.</p> <p>A simple way to create a dashboard using <code>PutDashboard</code> is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use <code>GetDashboard</code>, and then use the data returned within <code>DashboardBody</code> as the template for the new dashboard when you call <code>PutDashboard</code>.</p> <p>When you create a dashboard with <code>PutDashboard</code>, a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the <code>DashboardBody</code> script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.</p>

#### Input Parameters
* `Action` - _required_
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Credential` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Security-Token` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric or metric math expression.</p> <p>When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to <code>INSUFFICIENT_DATA</code>. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed.</p> <p>When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.</p> <p>If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some alarm operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> for all alarms with EC2 actions</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus</code> and <code>ec2:DescribeInstances</code> for all alarms on EC2 instance status metrics</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ec2:StopInstances</code> for alarms with stop actions</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ec2:TerminateInstances</code> for alarms with terminate actions</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ec2:DescribeInstanceRecoveryAttribute</code> and <code>ec2:RecoverInstances</code> for alarms with recover actions</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2, you can still create an alarm, but the stop or terminate actions are not performed. However, if you are later granted the required permissions, the alarm actions that you created earlier are performed.</p> <p>If you are using an IAM role (for example, an EC2 instance profile), you cannot stop or terminate the instance using alarm actions. However, you can still see the alarm state and perform any other actions such as Amazon SNS notifications or Auto Scaling policies.</p> <p>If you are using temporary security credentials granted using AWS STS, you cannot stop or terminate an EC2 instance using alarm actions.</p> <p>The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked role is called <code>AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role">AWS service-linked role</a>.</p>

#### Input Parameters
* `Action` - _required_
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_

* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### <p>Publishes metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch associates the data points with the specified metric. If the specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric. When CloudWatch creates a metric, it can take up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to <a>ListMetrics</a>.</p> <p>You can publish either individual data points in the <code>Value</code> field, or arrays of values and the number of times each value occurred during the period by using the <code>Values</code> and <code>Counts</code> fields in the <code>MetricDatum</code> structure. Using the <code>Values</code> and <code>Counts</code> method enables you to publish up to 150 values per metric with one <code>PutMetricData</code> request, and supports retrieving percentile statistics on this data.</p> <p>Each <code>PutMetricData</code> request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests. You can send a payload compressed by gzip. Each request is also limited to no more than 20 different metrics.</p> <p>Although the <code>Value</code> parameter accepts numbers of type <code>Double</code>, CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2). In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.</p> <p>You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the metric collects. For more information about specifying dimensions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html">Publishing Metrics</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least 48 hours to become available for <a>GetMetricData</a> or <a>GetMetricStatistics</a> from the time they are submitted.</p> <p>CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <code>SampleCount</code> value of the statistic set is 1 and <code>Min</code>, <code>Max</code>, and <code>Sum</code> are all equal.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>Min</code> and <code>Max</code> are equal, and <code>Sum</code> is equal to <code>Min</code> multiplied by <code>SampleCount</code>.</p> </li> </ul>

#### Input Parameters
* `Action` - _required_
* `Version` - _required_
* `X-Amz-Content-Sha256` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Date` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Algorithm` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Credential` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Security-Token` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-Signature` - _optional_
* `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` - _optional_

### Temporarily sets the state of an alarm for testing purposes. When the updated state differs from the previous value, the action configured for the appropriate state is invoked. For example, if your alarm is configured to send an Amazon SNS message when an alarm is triggered, temporarily changing the alarm state to <code>ALARM</code> sends an SNS message. The alarm returns to its actual state (often within seconds). Because the alarm state change happens quickly, it is typically only visible in the alarm's <b>History</b> tab in the Amazon CloudWatch console or through <a>DescribeAlarmHistory</a>.
